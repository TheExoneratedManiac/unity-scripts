# unity-scripts

cameraFollow is based off of Anup Prasad's Camera Following script

move is based off of the move towards code in John French's article on How to make an object follow the mouse in Unity (in 2D), but with my own addition of capped acceleration based on the distance between the mouse and the sprite, which relies on the camera follow script.
