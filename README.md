# unity-scripts

cameraFollow is based off of Anup Prasad's Camera Following script

move is based off of the move towards code in John French's article on How to make an object follow the mouse in Unity (in 2D), but with my own addition of capped acceleration based on the distance between the mouse and the sprite, which works best with the camera follow script.

npcMove is a randomized transform tool for sprites with time-based somewhat random acceleration. However, the movement is strictly up, down, left, or right. It also has adjustable maximum and minimum speeds, time between accelerations, and base movement speed.
